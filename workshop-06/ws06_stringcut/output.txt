As cameras become more pervasive in our daily life
, vast amounts of video data are generated. The po
pularity of YouTube and similar websites such as T

trajectories describe the rich dynamic content of 
video data. Motion trajectory analysis plays an im

Several aspects of motion trajectory analysis incl

learning from weakly labeled web video. A general

Part V. Video Mining: The final theme of the book 
is focused on empirical tasks in video mining. The
 scope of the discussion ranges from low-level tas

Another critical facet of video data is represente
